Release Workflow Troubleshooting:

- retag.sh
  1) Deletes local and remote git tags
  2) Creates tags with same version on current HEAD
  3) and pushes commits and tags again

Release notes are not automatically deleted on retag.sh usage. This for a
reason: They might be copied over to a fixed release and shouldn't be lost.

Optionally retag.sh accepts a third cli arg allowing to pass --options to the
push in step 3 (e.g. --force-with-lease, use with caution)
